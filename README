DESCRIPTION

anagram manager is a simple command line utility to find anagram groupings in a
file of text. Supply the name of a text file as the first command line argument
and it will return each anagram grouping. The file will be read in and separated 
into words. Following analysis, anagrams will be returned to the standard output 
in groupings, as shown below:

INSTRUCTIONS

For now, place the code into its own directory and run:

$ javac anagrams/Main.java anagrams/Reader.java anagrams/Word.java anagrams/Tree.java
$ java anagrams/Main [myfile]

EXAMPLE

Grouping: eilsv
lives elvis

Grouping: acrt
trac cart

Grouping: amrs
mars rams arms

BUGS

At the moment, this only finds "word" anagrams (not phrase anagrams, a la
"William Shakespeare" -> "I am a weakish speller"), where a word is defined as
any contiguous String of characters, converted to lower case, with trailing
punctuation discarded. Eligible words are separated by spaces. Contractions are
disregarded, a la "doesn't" -> "stoned".

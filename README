anagram manager is a simple command line utility to find anagram groupings in a
file of text. Supply the name of a text file as the first command line argument
and it will return each anagram grouping.

At the moment, this only finds "word" anagrams (not phrase anagrams, a la
"William Shakespeare" -> "I am a weakish speller"), where a word is defined as
any contiguous String of characters, converted to lower case, with trailing
punctuation discarded. Eligible words are separated by spaces. Contractions are
disregarded, a la "doesn't" -> "stoned".

For now, place the code into its own directory and run:

$ javac anagrams/Main.java anagrams/Reader.java anagrams/Word.java anagrams/Tree.java
$ java anagrams/Main [myfile]

The anagrams will be returned to the standard output in groupings, as shown
below:

Grouping: eilsv
lives elvis

Grouping: acrt
trac cart

Grouping: amrs
mars rams
